# **Beyond Dichotomy: A Critique of Ontological Flat-footedness in the Greek Tradition and Its Ideological Heirs**

## **1. Introduction: Plato's Shadow on the 21st Century**

Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks, built its edifice on dichotomies: form and matter, mind and body, the individual and the polis, freedom and necessity. These oppositions did not merely describe the world—they *constructed* it, carving from the living tissue of reality everything that did not fit within the logic of the excluded middle.

Over the centuries, these binary schemes became the foundation not only of metaphysics but of political ideologies. Liberalism and Marxism, seemingly mortal enemies, are in fact children of the same ontological map: both take for granted that the individual and society are opposing poles on a single axis. Neither questions the very topology of this space.

But life is not a debate in the Academy, nor a class struggle. Life is a continuous flow in which opposites do not exclude, but *generate* one another. To see this, we must step away from dichotomies and listen to what nature itself tells us—especially through a language the Greeks did not know: the language of information.

## **2. Ontological Flat-footedness: When the World is Flattened**

Greek philosophy sought clarity through reduction. Plato exiled ideas from the world to save them from the flux of change. Aristotle, while returning his focus to immanent essences, still divided the world into substance and accident, form and matter. These were all attempts to hold being within a static grid of categories.

But life is not static. It pulses, adapts, splits, and merges. It does not obey the logic of "either-or"—it lives in the realm of **and-and**: in a superposition of states, in the resonance between the internal and the external, between stability and change.

Thermodynamics teaches us that closed systems tend toward chaos. But living systems—from a bacterium to a human society—are stable not because they are closed, but because they are **open and informationally saturated**. Therein lies their ontological novelty. The Greeks, having no concept of entropy or information, could not see this. Theirs is a philosophy of forms, not of flows.

## **3. The False Antagonism of Ideologies**

Liberalism asserts that man is an autonomous agent, and society must be minimized so as not to interfere with his freedom. Marxism counters that man is a product of social conditions, and only the collective can free him from alienation.

But both approaches proceed from the same assumption: **the individual and society are separate entities in a state of tension**. Neither allows that a person can be an *innately social being* whose individuality does not precede, but *arises through* interaction.

It is like arguing whether the ant or the colony is more important in an anthill. The answer from biology is: neither. What is important is the **process**, in which both levels mutually define each other. But ideologies, which have inherited the Greek habit of substantiation, do not see the process—only subjects and objects.

## **4. Schrödinger as the Bridge**

In 1944, Erwin Schrödinger—a physicist, but also a profound philosopher—asked the question: *"What is life?"* He did not seek the answer in spirit, will, or ideas. He looked at life as a **physical paradox**: how can a system maintain order in defiance of the universal law of entropy growth?

His hypothesis was revolutionary: living organisms maintain order **not through closure, but through the exchange of information with their environment**. He posited the existence of an "aperiodic crystal"—a structure that stores a "code" capable of directing the behavior of the entire system. This was an intuitive glimpse of DNA, which would only be discovered a decade later.

But even more important was the **ontological shift**. Schrödinger showed that **information can be a fundamental ontological category**, on par with matter and energy. This information is not local: it is written in a microscopic structure, but it **acts globally**—defining the shape of an eye, the rhythm of a heart, the inclination toward cooperation.

And if genetic information extends from the cell to behavior, and behavior to culture, then **the boundary between the "biological" and the "social" dissolves**. Life is not a hierarchy of levels, but a **continuous field of non-local informational action**, where the individual and society are temporary nodes, not eternal opposites.

## **5. Conclusion: Beyond One-Dimensional Thinking**

Greek philosophy gave us logic, but it deprived us of topology. It insisted that the world could be understood by decomposing it into opposites. But life does not decompose—it **unfolds**, intertwines, and resonates.

Liberalism and Marxism are attempts to bring order to a distorted map. They toil on the same flat plane that Plato and Aristotle drew, and are therefore doomed to mutual refutation, but never to transcendence.

The way out is not a new ideology, but a new **ontology of life**: one not of struggle, but of superposition; not of hierarchy, but of network; not of substance, but of flow.

Schrödinger pointed the way: **reality is ordered not by force, but by information**. And perhaps herein lies the key not only to understanding life, but to liberating thought from Plato's shadow.
